# Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

# Container
Simply put, a container is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine.
* Is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the DockerAPI or CLI.
* Can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
* Is portable (can be run on any OS).
* Is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, and configurations.

# Container Image
When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a container image. Since the image contains the containerâ€™s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.
